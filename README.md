# Robo-spy-pigeon-phone
## May 16, 2024
Hello, welcome to my Robot-spy-pigeon-phone-assistant-project! (I'm bad at names I'll fix it later)
This is an idea I've had in my head for ages, and I really want to document one of my procrastination projects properly, so I'm just going to put everything I do onto this github, then procrastinate on my procrastination by fixing it later. 

So, robot phones. I think I was unreasonably influenced by Amy McCulloch's Jinxed series, which is a pretty good YA series in its own right. Basically the premise is that everyone has an animal-looking robot that does everything their phone used to do, and also is like a pet and friend and assistant, and idk I just think that's pretty cool. I would just make that but it'd kinda feel like plagiarism or something, which brings me to my second influence: Birds aren't real. I assume everyone has heard of this pseudo conspiracy, which is just hilarious and very much something my generation would make up in response to actual conspiracy theorists. Essentially, all birds were hunted down and killed by the US government/CIA in the 50s and 60s and replaced with spy drones that are tracking us, ooh scary. Finally: ornithopters. You know drones? They're like that but cooler, because they flap their wings. I'm not an aeronautical engineer (I'm just a highschooler actually), but I do have a very hyper plane loving little brother, so there's that

With these ideas in mind I have a bunch of features I want to implement at some point but may never, best explained through a series of tiny sketches:

Look at the little cyborg pigeon!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I'm so proud of my non-existent drawing skills. If you can't read my handwriting (valid, I can't either), here's some of the highlights:

- cute little perch
- holds a little pencil
- camera (or is it a death laser?)
- touchscreen
- eyes follow you around
- full 360¬∞ vision, head rotates
- foot clamps/jointed toes (taking inspiration from nerdforge's prosthetic finger but it defaults to contracted so it doesn't fall off the perch)
- Bits that move (perched edition): feet lift and flap, head rotates = 3 servos, optional bonus: balance body by tilting
- also some sound effects/comments ie. eeeee, creeeeak, ring ring..., unknown phone number...

I made a super cute lil cardboard/electrical tape model, feeling very professional

And if the ultra-high quality school laptop night photo didn't sell it to you, then I used an AAA battery as a stylus to sketch over it üôÉ

I also found some old(er) sketches and plans from when I wanted to make a cockatoo, so might as well put those in, there's no one reading this anyway lol

I probably shouldn't include that last one actually, it's kinda ruining the sci-fi super villain aesthetic I keep imagining. I don't wanna be strutting around with my cool pirate parrot pigeon phone on my shoulder acting all fancy and then get jump-scared by my 16y/o late night ramblings, but whatever.
